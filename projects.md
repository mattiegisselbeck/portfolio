## Projects 

#### Puerto Ricoâ€™s Spontaneous Reforestation
The aim of this project was to determine the most significant factors contributing to forest transition (~1950s-2000s) and to find a model that best predicts forest cover based on the explanatory variables. The explanatory variables under consideration comprise slope, soil productivity, precipitation, poverty rate, population density, and land protection level. To view the associated StoryMap, see
