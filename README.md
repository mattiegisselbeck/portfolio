# About 

I'm currently a graduate student within the MGIS Program at the University of Minnesota, and working as a graduate research assistant for forest resources at the University of Minnesota. Prior to the MGIS Program, I studided psychology with an emphasis on sustainability at the University of St. Thomas.

Currently, my studies within the MGIS Program are concentrated on web design, spatial data science, graphic design, and machine learning. My primary research interests center around utilizing spatial data science and machine learning methods to address issues related to natural resource management, human mobility, and environmental justice.
