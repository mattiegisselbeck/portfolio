## About 

I'm currently a graduate student within the MGIS Program at the University of Minnesota, and working as a graduate research assistant for forest resources at the University of Minnesota. Prior to the MGIS Program, I studided psychology with an emphasis on sustainability at the University of St. Thomas.

Currently, my studies within the MGIS Program are concentrated on web design, spatial data science, graphic design, and machine learning. My primary research interests center around utilizing spatial data science and machine learning methods to address issues related to natural resource management, human mobility, and environmental justice.

## Projects 

#### Puerto Ricoâ€™s Spontaneous Reforestation 
`Python` `Regression Models` `Random Forest` `Conservation` 
<br>
<br>
The aim of this project was to determine the most significant factors contributing to forest transition (~1950s-2000s) and to find a model that best predicts forest cover based on the explanatory variables. The explanatory variables under consideration comprise slope, soil productivity, precipitation, poverty rate, population density, and land protection level. To view the associated StoryMap, see [StoryMap](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/b8961440d1604d7aba09ebcb268fe07a). The repository for this project is shown below.

#### Environmental Justice Concern Prediction Using Random Forest
`Python` `Random Forest` `Environmental Justice` 
<br>
<br>
The objective of this project was to use Random Forest to predict whether census tracts in the Twin Cities Metro Area (TCMA) are areas of environmental justice concern and visually display the predictions using an interactive map.

#### Analyzing Environmental Justice Concerns in Minneapolis-St.Paul
`SQL` `Environmental Justice` 
<br>
<br>
Historically redlined neighborhoods were and are areas of concentrated poverty. Low-income neighborhoods and Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) communities in the TCMA are heavily urbanized, have a higher potential exposure to pollutants, and are more vulnerable to environmental factors. To combat this inequality, environmental justice seeks to address the inequity of environmental protection in their communities, and attempts to restore this disparity. This project analyzes census tracts in the Twin Cities Metro Area (TCMA) that fall within areas of environmental justice concern, considering various equity considerations.
